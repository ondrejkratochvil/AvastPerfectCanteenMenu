Most importantly, youâ€™ll need bitbar app: https://getbitbar.com

You'll also need Python 2.7.*, but that's probably part of your macOs

---

Then you'll need homebrew (https://brew.sh) and then:

> brew install libxml2

> pip install lxml

---

And after you add .py file into Bitbar directory, you'll need to give it executable permissions:

> chmod +x avast_menu.5m.py

---

That's it. Enjoy...
